# 🌿 AQIStayPure – EcoHack 2021

**AQIStayPure** is a web-based application developed during the **EcoHack 2021** hackathon. The project aimed to raise awareness about air quality and promote eco-friendly practices. Designed by a team of four students with limited coding experience, the application serves as a testament to collaborative learning and innovation.

### 📚 Project Overview

AQIStayPure is a web application designed to provide real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) information to users, helping them monitor environmental pollution levels in their area. The app fetches live AQI data from a public API and displays it in a user-friendly format, along with relevant health advisories and tips for maintaining cleaner air.

- The frontend is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, making the app lightweight and easy to use in any modern web browser.
- The core functionality is handled in the `app.js` file, which:
  - Fetches current AQI data from an external API based on the user’s location or selected city.
  - Parses and processes the JSON response to extract key metrics such as AQI value, pollutant concentrations, and health recommendations.
  - Dynamically updates the webpage to display this information with appropriate color codes indicating the pollution level (e.g., green for good, red for hazardous).
  - Provides actionable advice to users on how to minimize exposure or contribute to cleaner air.
- The interface is designed to be simple and intuitive, encouraging users to check air quality regularly and make environmentally conscious decisions.
