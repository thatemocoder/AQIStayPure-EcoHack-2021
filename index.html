			<h1>Information</h1>
			<p>Monitoring helps in assessing the level of pollution in relation to the ambient air quality standards. Standards are a regulatory measure to set the target for pollution reduction and achieve clean air. Robust monitoring helps to guard against extreme events by alerting people and initiate action.

			<h1>Precautions</h1>
			<p>  Regularly check AQI levels of your cities to check the levels of safety you should take.
				Dust Masks are a first when it comes to slightly high AQI.
				Air purifiers are a must for indoors to reduce particles and filter the air.    Staying indoors, reading a book and watching TV is also a way to reduce activity as aware citizens and even for personal benefits.
				If you have even the slightest hints of breathing issues immediately visit a doctor.</p>

			<h1>About us</h1>
			<p>We are members of 2PLUS2, freshers from VIT Vellore. With the little knowledge we have and with help of available resources we have come up with AQ-I STAYSAFE. This webpage allows users to know the Air Quality Index[AQI] of your place by using just the userâ€™s location. Finding out the AQI can help users to know the severity of air pollution in and around your area. With the current situation of heavy air pollution and smog it is very important to keep yourselves  healthy and to do your part in controlling the air pollution as much as possible.Hopefully you had a good time trying things out on our website.</p>
